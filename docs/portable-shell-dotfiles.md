# Making Your Shell Environment Portable: Dotfiles, Git, and 10x Zsh Everywhere

A guide to ensuring your terminal is always powerful, familiar, and productive—on any machine, local or remote.

---

## Why Portability Matters

- A great shell setup is a superpower—but only if you have it everywhere you work: local, remote, new laptops, cloud VMs, etc.
- The terminal only "sucks" when it's not set up right. With a portable, versioned config, you're always at home in your shell.

---

## What Are Dotfiles?

- "Dotfiles" are your shell and tool config files (e.g., `.zshrc`, `.gitconfig`, `.vimrc`, etc.).
- Managing them with Git lets you:
  - Instantly set up a new machine or remote server.
  - Keep your config in sync everywhere.
  - Experiment safely (rollback, branch, etc.).
  - Share and learn from others' setups.

---

## Strategies for Managing Dotfiles

### 1. **Simple Git Repo (Symlink Approach)**
- Store your dotfiles in a Git repo (e.g., `~/dotfiles`).
- Symlink them into your home directory.
- Example:  
  ```sh
  ln -s ~/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
  ```

### 2. **Bare Git Repo ("Dotbare" Pattern)**
- Keep your home directory as the working tree, but store the Git repo elsewhere.
- No symlinks needed; files live in `~`.
- Example setup:  
  ```sh
  git clone --bare git@github.com:yourname/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles
  alias dotfiles='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'
  dotfiles checkout
  ```

### 3. **Dotfile Managers**
- Tools like [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/), [yadm](https://yadm.io/), or [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) automate syncing, templating, and OS-specific config.

---

## Keeping Secrets Out of Dotfiles

- Never commit secrets (API keys, tokens, etc.) to your dotfiles repo.
- Use `.gitignore` for local-only files (e.g., `.zshrc.local`).
- Consider tools like [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt) or [sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) for encrypted secrets if needed.

---

## Bootstrapping Your Environment Anywhere

1. **Clone Your Dotfiles Repo**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url> ~/dotfiles-examples
   cd ~/dotfiles-examples
   ./bootstrap.sh
   ```
2. **Customize as Needed**
   - Add plugins, aliases, or modular configs to `zshrc.d/`.
   - Place secrets in `.zshrc.local` (never commit this file).

## Making `.zshrc` Portable: OS & SSH Detection

See [`dotfiles-examples/.zshrc`](dotfiles-examples/.zshrc) for a full example.

**OS Detection Example:**
```sh
if [[ "$OSTYPE" == "darwin"* ]]; then
  export OS_TYPE="macos"
elif [[ "$OSTYPE" == "linux-gnu"* ]]; then
  export OS_TYPE="linux"
fi
```

**SSH Session Detection Example:**
```sh
if [[ -n "$SSH_CONNECTION" ]]; then
  export IS_SSH="1"
  # Optionally disable heavy plugins, change prompt, etc.
fi
```

**Conditional Plugin Loading Example:**
```sh
if [[ "$OS_TYPE" == "macos" ]]; then
  # macOS-specific plugins or paths
elif [[ "$OS_TYPE" == "linux" ]]; then
  # Linux-specific plugins or paths
fi
```

## Syncing to Remote Servers

- SSH into your remote box.
- Clone your dotfiles repo and run your bootstrap/install script.
- Use SSH detection in `.zshrc` to adjust your environment (e.g., lighter prompt, fewer plugins).

---

## Example: Reference Dotfiles

- See the [`dotfiles-examples/`](dotfiles-examples/) directory in this repo for a real-world, cross-platform, SSH-aware setup.
- Features:
  - OS and SSH detection in `.zshrc`
  - Modular config (split into `zshrc.d/`)
  - Bootstrap script for new machines
  - `.gitignore` for secrets/local overrides

---

## Agent Prompts

- "Help me set up a dotfiles repo for my shell config."
- "How do I sync my Zsh setup to a remote server?"
- "Show me how to detect SSH or OS in my .zshrc."
- "What's the best way to keep secrets out of my dotfiles?"

**Tip:**  
A portable shell is a force multiplier. Invest in your dotfiles and you'll always feel at home in the terminal—anywhere.
