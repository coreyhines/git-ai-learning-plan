## Pre-commit Hooks & Linting

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to enforce Markdown and whitespace standards before every commit.

> **We use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python package management.** It's faster and more reliable than raw pip. Always use `uv pip install ...` instead of `pip install ...`.

**To check/fix all files manually:**
```sh
./run-precommit-checks.sh
```

> The CI will also run these checks. Please ensure your commits pass locally to avoid failed builds.
