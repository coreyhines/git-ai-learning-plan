## Module 1: Kickstart – Your AI Mentor & Git in Action

- **Meet Your AI Mentor**
  - How the AI will guide, review, and unblock you
  - Example: Asking the AI to explain, fix, or generate code
- **Instant Git Setup**
  - Initialize a repo, make your first commit, and push to GitHub (with AI guidance)
  - Using the AI to explain each step and troubleshoot errors
- **Integrate Cursor IDE with GitHub**
  - Open Cursor IDE and go to the settings or preferences menu.
  - Find the "Version Control" or "GitHub" integration section.
  - Sign in with your GitHub account and authorize Cursor IDE.
  - Clone a repository from GitHub using Cursor's interface, or open an existing local repo and connect it to GitHub.
  - Confirm that you can see Git status, commit, push, and pull directly from Cursor.
- **Test Your Integration with the AI Mentor**
  - Use this prompt to have the agent verify your setup:
    > "Agent, please check if my Cursor IDE is properly connected to GitHub. Try making a test commit and pushing it to my repository. If there are any issues, guide me through fixing them."
