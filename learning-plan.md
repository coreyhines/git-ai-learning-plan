## Module 1: Kickstart – Your AI Mentor & Git in Action

- **Meet Your AI Mentor**
  - How the AI will guide, review, and unblock you
  - Example: Asking the AI to explain, fix, or generate code
- **Instant Git Setup**
  - Initialize a repo, make your first commit, and push to GitHub (with AI guidance)
  - Using the AI to explain each step and troubleshoot errors
- **Integrate Cursor IDE with GitHub**
  - Open Cursor IDE and go to the settings or preferences menu.
  - Find the "Version Control" or "GitHub" integration section.
  - Sign in with your GitHub account and authorize Cursor IDE.
  - Clone a repository from GitHub using Cursor's interface, or open an existing local repo and connect it to GitHub.
  - Confirm that you can see Git status, commit, push, and pull directly from Cursor.
- **Test Your Integration with the AI Mentor**
  - Use this prompt to have the agent verify your setup:
    > "Check if my Cursor IDE is properly connected to GitHub. Try making a test commit and push it to my repository. If there are any issues, help me fix them."

## Module 2: Branching, Iterating, and Rolling Back – Fast

- **Branching with AI**
  - Create, switch, and merge branches with AI help
  - AI suggestions for branch naming and workflow
- **Iterate Rapidly**
  - Use the AI to propose, review, and implement changes
  - Rollback mistakes: reset, revert, checkout (AI explains and assists)

## Module 4: Supercharge with Model Context Protocols (MCP)

- **What is MCP?**
  - How MCP tools expand your AI's context and capabilities
- **Hands-On: Install & Use a Free MCP Tool**
  - Example: Setting up and using MCP CLI or browser extension
  - Use AI to search code, share context, and automate tasks

## Module 5: Real-World Project – Rapid Co-Development

- **Build Something Real, Fast**
  - Define a small project (e.g., CLI tool, web app) with AI brainstorming
  - Use AI and Git together to plan, build, and iterate
  - Practice branching, merging, rollbacks, and PRs in a real scenario
  - Use MCP tools to enhance your workflow
- **Go Deeper:**  
  - [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/)  
  - [Effective Pair Programming](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html)

## Best Practices for Prompting Cursor-Style Agents

- **Be Specific and Contextual:**  
  Clearly state your goal, provide relevant code or file references, and specify the language or framework if needed.
- **Use Step-by-Step (Chain-of-Thought) Prompts:**  
  For complex tasks, break your request into steps or ask the agent to explain its reasoning as it works.
- **Give Examples (Few-Shot Prompting):**  
  If you want a certain style or format, provide a short example in your prompt.
- **Iterate and Refine:**  
  Don't expect perfection on the first try—ask follow-up questions, request clarifications, and refine your prompt as needed.
- **Ask for Explanations:**  
  If you don't understand a suggestion, ask the agent to explain its reasoning or the code it generated.
- **Leverage Cursor Rules:**  
  Use `.cursorrules` to set project-specific guidelines for the agent, such as coding style, error handling, or naming conventions.
- **Review and Test AI-Generated Code:**  
  Always review, test, and validate code before merging or deploying.
- **Be Polite and Clear:**  
  While not required, a friendly and clear tone can improve results and make collaboration smoother.
