# Agentic AI Development Learning Plan

This learning plan is designed for developers who are experienced with programming but want to level up their development workflow using modern tools, agentic AI assistance, and best practices.

## Prerequisites
- Basic programming experience in any language
- Basic command line familiarity
- A modern computer with ability to install software
- Willingness to learn and adapt to new workflows

## Phase 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment

### 1.1 Essential Tools Installation
- Install [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) - The AI-powered IDE
- Install Git
- Set up a GitHub account
- Install Oh My Zsh (optional but recommended)
  - Popular plugins: git, ssh-agent, dotenv, autosuggestions
  - Theme recommendations and customization

### 1.2 Basic Git Configuration
- Configuring global Git settings
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  ```
- Setting up SSH keys for GitHub
  - Generating new SSH keys
  - Adding keys to GitHub account
  - Testing SSH connection

### 1.3 Initial Repository Setup
- Creating a new repository on GitHub
- Cloning vs initializing locally
- Basic git commands explained:
  ```bash
  git init
  git remote add origin <url>
  git add .
  git commit -m "message"
  git push -u origin main
  ```

#### Example AI Prompts for Repository Setup
```
"Create a new GitHub repository called 'my-project' with a basic README and MIT license"

"Initialize git in my current directory and set up the remote for my new GitHub repository"

"Help me create my first commit and push it to the main branch"

"I have a local project that I want to push to GitHub. Can you help me set that up?"
```

## Phase 2: Leveraging AI in Your Workflow

### 2.1 Project Initialization Best Practices
- Using AI to generate comprehensive README files
- Setting up project structure
- Implementing `.gitignore` and other essential files
- Creating development environment configurations
- Setting up linting and formatting tools

### 2.2 AI-Assisted Development
- How to effectively communicate with AI
- Using AI for:
  - Code generation
  - Documentation
  - Testing
  - Debugging
  - Code review
- Understanding AI's capabilities and limitations

#### Example AI Prompts for Development Tasks
```
"Review my code changes and help me write a good commit message"

"I want to create a new feature branch for implementing user authentication. Can you help me with the git commands?"

"Can you help me resolve these merge conflicts in my package.json file?"

"I need to undo my last commit that hasn't been pushed yet. What's the safest way to do that?"
```

### 2.3 Best Practices with AI
- Writing clear and specific prompts
- Reviewing and understanding generated code
- When to use AI vs. when to code manually
- Maintaining code ownership and understanding

## Phase 3: Advanced Git Workflows

### 3.1 Branching Strategies
- Understanding Git Flow
- Feature branches
- Release branches
- Hotfix branches
- Branch naming conventions

### 3.2 Pull Requests
- Creating meaningful PRs
- Writing effective PR descriptions
- Review processes
- Handling feedback and iterations
- Merging strategies

#### Example AI Prompts for Pull Requests
```
"Create a pull request for my feature branch with a description of the changes I made"

"Review the changes in my PR and suggest improvements"

"Help me write a detailed PR description for these changes: [list of changes]"

"What's the best way to merge this PR while maintaining a clean git history?"
```

### 3.3 Collaboration Best Practices
- Commit message conventions
- Code review etiquette
- Handling merge conflicts
- Using GitHub issues effectively
- Project boards and milestones

#### Example AI Prompts for Collaboration
```
"Help me write a conventional commit message for these changes: [description of changes]"

"Create a new issue for a bug I found in the login system"

"I need to cherry-pick a commit from the main branch to my feature branch"

"Help me set up a project board for tracking feature development"
```

## Phase 4: Development Environment Optimization

### 4.1 Shell Environment
- Customizing Oh My Zsh
- Essential aliases and functions
- Managing dotfiles
- Terminal multiplexers (tmux)

### 4.2 IDE Optimization
- Cursor keyboard shortcuts
- Custom snippets
- AI prompt templates
- Workspace organization

### 4.3 Security Best Practices
- Managing secrets and environment variables
- SSH key management
- GPG signing commits
- Security scanning tools

#### Example AI Prompts for Security Tasks
```
"Help me generate and add an SSH key to my GitHub account"

"Set up GPG signing for my commits and configure git to use it"

"I accidentally committed a secret key. How can I remove it from the git history?"

"Help me create a .gitignore file that excludes sensitive information"
```

### New Section: Effective AI Prompting for Git Operations

#### General Tips for AI Git Prompts
1. Be specific about your current state
   ```
   "I'm on branch 'feature/login' and want to update it with changes from main"
   ```

2. Include relevant error messages
   ```
   "I got this git error when trying to push: [error message]. What should I do?"
   ```

3. Specify your desired outcome
   ```
   "I want to combine my last 3 commits into one before pushing to the remote"
   ```

4. Ask for explanations
   ```
   "Can you explain what this git command does and why we're using these flags?"
   ```

#### Common Scenarios and Example Prompts

1. Branch Management
   ```
   "Create a new branch for implementing feature X and set it up for tracking"
   
   "I need to switch to a different branch but have uncommitted changes"
   
   "Help me rename my current branch from X to Y"
   ```

2. History Management
   ```
   "Show me how to view the git history for this specific file"
   
   "I need to find which commit introduced this bug"
   
   "Help me clean up my commit history before creating a PR"
   ```

3. Remote Operations
   ```
   "Add a new remote repository and fetch its contents"
   
   "Update my fork with changes from the upstream repository"
   
   "Push my changes to multiple remote repositories"
   ```

4. Recovery Operations
   ```
   "Help me recover a deleted branch that wasn't pushed"
   
   "I need to undo changes that were pushed to the remote"
   
   "Restore a specific file from a previous commit"
   ```

5. Configuration
   ```
   "Set up my git configuration with my name and email"
   
   "Configure git to always rebase instead of merge on pull"
   
   "Help me set up git aliases for common commands"
   ```
